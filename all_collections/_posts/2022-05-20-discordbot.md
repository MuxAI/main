### About
This webpage will be updated with any new features or improvements. Most importantly, you'll know when it will be ready for public usage! At the moment, only a few servers and users have been authorized to beta test the bot out on my behalf. If you're one of those lucky folk by any chance, then I thank you for visiting this website.

Alright, you know what? Go ahead and invite the bot to your server. Remove any permissions which you believe are not necessary.

So far, I was struggling to troubleshoot and patch up lots of errors. Particularly, 20th May 2022 was my first day handling NodeJS from scratch. I mainly tried to migrate some of the previous plugins for my bots written in Python to NodeJS. And boy, o boy! Took me more than 4 hours to get the fair basics completed. Anyways, I'm glad that things are going the way I expected them... at the cost of time and mental strain!

### Devlog
```
✔️ 20 May 2022 : Development started. Fierce programming in progress. Managed to create buttons using DiscordJS v13.
✔️ 21 May 2022 : Began implementing music commands. Was programming for more than 10 hours. Result not complete yet.
✔️ 22 May 2022 : Success! Music features are now available. But I still gotta find a way to reduce latency to improve the bitrate.
🔥 23 May 2022 : Decided to switch to a different bot for all of MuxDay's music features. Designed new logos using Canva.
```

Stay tuned!
