<pre><span class="s0">The problems are loosely based on the exercises presented in the course textbook.</span>

<span class="s2">1.  </span><span class="s0">Open the </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">figures</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">project from Chapter 1 and save it as a </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">lab\_1\_picture</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">project.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Recreate the image below using the shapes from the </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">figures</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">project. </span><span class="s1">![</span><span class="s0">Horizon</span><span class="s1">](</span><span class="s0">../images/BK1.png </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s0">Horizon</span><span class="s1">&quot;)</span><span class="s0"> </span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">While you are doing this, write down what you have to do to achieve this. Could it be done in different ways? Next record the state of your objects and create a new class MyPicture with a single method draw. Inside the draw method write the code to draw the image.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Add a sunset to the Picture. That is, make the sun go down slowly. Remember</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s0">The circle has a method slowMoveVertical that you can use to do this.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">If you added your sunset to the end of the draw method </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s0">so that the sun goes down automatically when the picture is drawn</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s0">, change this now. We now want the sunset in a separate method, so that we can call draw and see the picture with the sun up, and then call sunset </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s0">a separate method</span><span class="s1">!) </span><span class="s0">to make the sun go down.</span>


<span class="s2">2.  </span><span class="s0">Close your previous project and create a new project </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">testing\_code\_pad</span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">. Select </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">Show Code Pad</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">from the </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">View</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">menu. This should display a new pane next to the object bench in your main BlueJ window. This pane is the Code Pad. You can type Java code here. Consider the following expressions. Try to predict their results, and then type them in the Code Pad to check your answers.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">99 + 3</span>

<span class="s2">3.  </span><span class="s0">Open the </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">lab-classes</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">project from Chapter 1</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Create an object of class </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Student</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">. You will notice that this time you are prompted not only for a name of the instance, but also for some other parameters. Fill them in before clicking OK.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Create some additional </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Student</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">objects. Call the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">getName</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method on each object. Explain what is happening.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Create an object of class </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">LabClass</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">. As the signature indicates, you need to specify the maximum number of students in that class </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s0">an integer</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s0">.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Call the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">numberOfStudents</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method of that class. What does it do?</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Look at the signature of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">enrollStudent</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method. You will notice that the type of the expected parameter is </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Student</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">. Make sure you have two or three students and a </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">LabClass</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">object on the object bench, then call the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">enrollStudent</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">LabClass</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">object. With the input cursor in the dialog entry field, click on one of the student objects; this enters the name of the student object into the parameter field of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">enrollStudent</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method. Click OK and you have added the student to the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">LabClass</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">. Add one or more other students as well.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Call the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">printList</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">LabClass</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">object. You will see a list of all the students in that class printed to the BlueJ terminal window.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Use the inspector on a </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">LabClass</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">object to discover what fields it has.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Set the instructor, room, and time for a lab, and print the list to the terminal window to check that these new details appear.</span>


<span class="s2">4.  </span><span class="s0">Open the </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">mail</span><span class="s1">_ </span><span class="s0">project from chapter 3.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Set up a scenario for investigation</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s0">Create a mail server, then create two mail clients for the users </span><span class="s1">&quot;**</span><span class="s0">Sophie</span><span class="s1">**&quot; </span><span class="s0">and “</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Juan</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">” </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s0">you should name the instances </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">sophie</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">and </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">juan</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">as well so that you can better distinguish them on the object bench</span><span class="s1">)</span><span class="s0">. Then use Sophie’s </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">sendMailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method to send a message to Juan. Do not read the message yet.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Open the editor for the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class and set a breakpoint at the first line of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">printNextMailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Run Juan's Client</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s0">s </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">printNextMailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Step one line forward in the execution of the recipient's </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">printNextMailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method by clicking the Step button.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Predict which line will be marked as the next line to execute after the next step. Then execute another single step and check your prediction. Were you right or wrong? Explain what happened and why.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Set up the same test situation as before. That is, send a message from </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Sophie</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">to </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Juan</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">. Then invoke the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">printNextMailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">message of Juan’s mail client again. Step forward as before. This time, when you reach the line </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">item.print</span><span class="s1">()</span><span class="s0">;</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0"> use the Step Into command instead of the Step command. Make sure you can see the text terminal window as you step forward. What do you observe? Explain what you see.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Set a breakpoint in the first line of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">sendMailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">method in the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class. Then invoke this method. Use the Step Into function to step into the constructor of the mail item. In the debugger display for the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">object, you can see the instance variables and local variables. Step further to see the instance variables get initialized.</span>
    <span class="s2">*   </span><span class="s0">Use a combination of code reading, execution of methods, breakpoints, and single stepping to familiarize yourself with the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">and </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">classes. Note that we have not yet discussed enough for you to understand the implementation of the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailServer</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class, so you can ignore this for now. Explain how the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">and </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailItem</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">classes interact. Draw object diagrams as part of your explanations.</span>


<span class="s2">5. </span><span class="s1">(</span><span class="s0">Lab Credit Instructions</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s0">Open your COMP2001 submission project for the following credit work</span>
    <span class="s2">*  </span><span class="s0">Import the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Lab1Distro</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">project into your COMP2001 submission project.</span>
    <span class="s2">*  </span><span class="s0">Confirm that the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Lab1Credit</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">package and the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">TestGradeExtension</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">packages are present in your submission project</span>
    <span class="s2">*  </span><span class="s0">Open the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Lab1Credit</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">package and complete this lab credit work by modifying the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class</span>
    <span class="s2">*  </span><span class="s0">Modify the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class to implement the methods described in </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClientInterface</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">so you can compile the java code in the package. Start by changing the declaration line of </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">to indicate the implementation requirement. This will create compile errors until the required implementation is satisfied by your code changes. The resulting  </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">declaration line should now look as follows</span><span class="s1">:</span>

           <span class="s3">public class MailClient implements MailClientInterface</span>

    <span class="s2">* </span><span class="s0">Modify the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class to comply with the method signatures required by the  </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClientInterface</span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">. This should allow the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class to compile without compile errors.</span>
    <span class="s2">* </span><span class="s0">Run the JUNIT tests included in the package to check your lab score. Test scores should appear in the terminal window when you run the JUNIT tests.</span>
    <span class="s2">* </span><span class="s0">Work on modifying the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">MailClient</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">class to pass the included tests up to the end of the lab period. Don't forget the debugging tools practiced in exercise 4 are available to help you.</span>
    <span class="s2">* </span><span class="s0">Commit and push your submission project that includes your modification to the </span><span class="s1">**</span><span class="s0">Lab1Credit</span><span class="s1">** </span><span class="s0">package </span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">before the end of the lab session</span><span class="s1">_</span><span class="s0">.  Only the most recent push to the remote git repository prior to the end of the lab session will count toward the lab grade. Since you can commit and push as many times as you want, you should consider pushing your changes wherever your score improves.</span>
