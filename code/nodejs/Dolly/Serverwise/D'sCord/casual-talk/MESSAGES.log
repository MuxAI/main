Your Local Degenerate#5964 said: may i ask?
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: wtf is going on
Muxto#8483 said: Many bots do. You don't even notice. For my case, it was for analysis purposes and safety reasons, too.
I was expecting to find some predators. Instead, I found immature teens.
Your Local Degenerate#5964 said: what do you expect us to be?
Muxto#8483 said: don't dare to spill the beans to anyone else. Otherwise, I'm sending a copy of the entire chat to your homeroom teacher!
Muxto#8483 said: well-behaved little kids, perhaps?
Your Local Degenerate#5964 said: bruh
Your Local Degenerate#5964 said: you expect some angsty teens of this age to be well-behaved?
Muxto#8483 said: You were supposed to be innocent and pure, before the harsh reality hits you. But instead, you're all li'l grown ups.
Your Local Degenerate#5964 said: my friends already know

Muxto#8483 said: <@757148419277193218> New website!

Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Alr
Muxto#8483 said: send a sus/malicious link
Muxto#8483 said: see what happens
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Wdym?
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Tht website malicious??
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Wat r u up to? Tryna be a malicious user now??
Muxto#8483 said: No, just for testing <@977262952354828308>
Muxto#8483 said: New feature that autodeletes unknown links
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: ohh
Muxto#8483 said: Lol
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Stupid .e
Muxto#8483 said: If you cannot find any, just misspell a normal link
Muxto#8483 said: That's how most scam links work
Muxto#8483 said: They look very similar to the genuine ones
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Also i rlly do realise tht ur whole batch is millennial, cuz today maimuna miss didnt understand wat "bussin" meant at first (we were doing an activity in our book which told us to list some slangs of our generations so we did) and then later we explained her wat it is and how to use it, later she tried for a sentence as well lol
Muxto#8483 said: Oh, lol
Muxto#8483 said: Anyways... Just type a link
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Alr
Muxto#8483 said: Replace a letter
Muxto#8483 said: Misspell it
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: @üç± New website!
https://muxwork.com/musicbot
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Damn
Muxto#8483 said: See?
Muxto#8483 said: üòé
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: No more malicious user tryna send unknown links now yay
Muxto#8483 said: In this way, when someone gets hacked, they can't send any FREE Nitro links anymore
Muxto#8483 said: Because they often tag `everyone`
Muxto#8483 said: And spam in every channel
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: But ur bot does spy on servers which is both good(to track down malicious users) and bad(stop looking into ppl's private chats)
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: üòï
Muxto#8483 said: Not really. A bot is just like a user
Muxto#8483 said: It's the same as inviting me to a server
Muxto#8483 said: Lol
Muxto#8483 said: Nothing invasive or bad
Muxto#8483 said: About reading msgs
Muxto#8483 said: Discord themselves always track msgs. And even other bots do. But they don't expose it.
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: but u still do can read their private msgs(speaking of strangers ones mostly)
Muxto#8483 said: I'm honest and I tell exactly what my bot does.
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Oh
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Well thts good then
Muxto#8483 said: Not really. If they are true strangers, I wouldnt bother.
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Wat if u wanted ur bot in Goldcode üòà
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Nah forget it , they'd start a raid on u if they get to knw it spies
Muxto#8483 said: Nothing much. As long as they don't discuss about a terrorist project they're upto, I won't care.
Muxto#8483 said: My point is simple : Talk about dangerous things or things harmful to others, then I'll take action.
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Lol they rnt like tht but r just some normal gang of bullies and toxic ppl
Muxto#8483 said: This is what a true "safety" bot is, anyway
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Nah u wont do the action, u will just let the authority knw abt it, they'll handle tht, u dont take the action alr?
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: I think u've become a "fbi agent" or sth
Muxto#8483 said: Also... If someone doesn't know that I made the bot, dont tell them about it.
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Aight
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Just dont cause trouble or put urself into trouble, u gotta make sure u r safe as well
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: <@784119755111661569>
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Also
Marlizo Hamachi#9374 said: Watched the new eps today alone
