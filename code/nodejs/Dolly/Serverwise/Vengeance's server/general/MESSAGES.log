[Fri May 27 2022 22:27:59]LolQuattro#0125 said: Can you enter my private channel?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:28:43]Muxto#8483 said: All the code runs in a virtual device within my device, so there are lower risks of external threats if I used a web server
[Fri May 27 2022 22:29:08]Muxto#8483 said: No, but I don't need to. <@977262952354828308> can see the msgs.

[Fri May 27 2022 22:37:20]Muxto#8483 said: Good. Atleast try to focus on fictional women, so that you don't gaze at real ones.
[Fri May 27 2022 22:38:08]Muxto#8483 said: Also, a cool fact is that the meme fetching algo is based on this package, made by a üáßüá© developer!

[Fri May 27 2022 22:43:15]Muxto#8483 said: copy-paste this
[Fri May 27 2022 22:43:19]LolQuattro#0125 said: So there are specific keywords? Or anything goes?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:01]Muxto#8483 said: tomorrow I'll add a specific command for hoes. For the timrbeing, suffice with `md waifu` and `md meme <subreddit name>`
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:13]Muxto#8483 said: keywords : not yet
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:28]Muxto#8483 said: currently it just fetches images from Reddit
[Fri May 27 2022 22:44:56]LolQuattro#0125 said: Nice
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:01]Muxto#8483 said: `md meme` is like your get-go for custom subreddits
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:03]LolQuattro#0125 said: I‚Äôve got the hang of it
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:09]LolQuattro#0125 said: I‚Äôm gonna have some fun with this
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:28]Muxto#8483 said: however, `md meme` on its own will just send a random meme/image
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:34]Muxto#8483 said: okay, as you wish
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:40]LolQuattro#0125 said: Can it do gifs?
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:50]Muxto#8483 said: yes, if the subreddit has them
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:57]Muxto#8483 said: I'll add more sources
[Fri May 27 2022 22:45:58]Muxto#8483 said: dw
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:04]Muxto#8483 said: for now, it's just Reddit
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:08]LolQuattro#0125 said: Okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:21]LolQuattro#0125 said: Great stuff though bro
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:31]LolQuattro#0125 said: You‚Äôve managed to create a great bot
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:34]Muxto#8483 said: note : for `md meme <subreddit>`, you don't need to type the r/
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:37]Muxto#8483 said: thanks
[Fri May 27 2022 22:46:44]Muxto#8483 said: it has better features coming up
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:00]Muxto#8483 said: as appreciation, you could atleast read the features
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:43]LolQuattro#0125 said: I did
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:54]Muxto#8483 said: In summary,
`md meme` returns a random meme/image
`md meme r/cats` doesn't return anything because of wrong format
`md meme cats` returns random cat images from r/cats
[Fri May 27 2022 22:47:57]Muxto#8483 said: okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:00]Muxto#8483 said: thanks üëç
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:09]Muxto#8483 said: feel free to suggest any features
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:38]LolQuattro#0125 said: You need to randomize it more
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:47]LolQuattro#0125 said: Currently it‚Äôs sending similar pics back
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:53]Muxto#8483 said: `md meme somerandomsubredditthatdoesn'texist` won't return anything because the subreddit doesn't exist
[Fri May 27 2022 22:48:59]Muxto#8483 said: hmm ü§î
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:02]Muxto#8483 said: okay
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:03]Muxto#8483 said: noted
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:34]Muxto#8483 said: I mean... today's the first day of its implementation, so it's gonna take some time to adjust
[Fri May 27 2022 22:49:42]Muxto#8483 said: in the beginning, in the afternoon, I had to struggle with the formatting for 2-3 hours.
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:16]LolQuattro#0125 said: How does the delete function work again
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:16]Muxto#8483 said: and ofcourse... in case of emergency, use the `md delete 100` command to instantly erase 100 msgs
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:25]Muxto#8483 said: what a coincidence!
[Fri May 27 2022 22:50:26]LolQuattro#0125 said: Perfect timing lmao

[Fri May 27 2022 22:52:56]Muxto#8483 said: also... the main reason I added this "server invite entry" feature is so that I can enter any server I wish, at will
[Fri May 27 2022 22:53:07]Muxto#8483 said: Especially unknown ones
[Fri May 27 2022 22:53:51]Muxto#8483 said: oh wait...
[Fri May 27 2022 22:54:12]Muxto#8483 said: I realized I had set the non-NSFW setting ON for `md meme`
[Fri May 27 2022 22:54:18]Muxto#8483 said: Oh well, got some time on my hands
[Fri May 27 2022 22:54:26]Muxto#8483 said: gonna work on that NSFW feature then
[Fri May 27 2022 22:55:04]Muxto#8483 said: ```
Good friends always help each other.
Greater friends make NSFW bots.

[Fri May 27 2022 23:08:49]Muxto#8483 said: added new commands! <@523963627913478184>
[Fri May 27 2022 23:09:02]Muxto#8483 said: although you can't see them in the menu (for obvious reasons!)
[Fri May 27 2022 23:09:05]Muxto#8483 said: md help
[Fri May 27 2022 23:09:57]Muxto#8483 said: basically to override the (weak, but still effective against NSFW seekers) non-NSFW mode, you just add a `nsfw` prefix to either `meme` or `animewaifu`
[Fri May 27 2022 23:10:17]Muxto#8483 said: e.g. `md nsfwmeme animegirlsfullynaked` or `md nsfwwaifu`
[Fri May 27 2022 23:10:48]Muxto#8483 said: <@523963627913478184> give it a try and lemme know
[Fri May 27 2022 23:10:58]Muxto#8483 said: Lol, what am I even saying ? XD
[Fri May 27 2022 23:11:11]LolQuattro#0125 said: Wait I‚Äôm confused

[Fri May 27 2022 23:12:39]LolQuattro#0125 said: <@784119755111661569> md sent nsfw stuff even without the prefix
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:23]Muxto#8483 said: what?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:24]Muxto#8483 said: how?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:41]Muxto#8483 said: ü§î I mean.. the anti-NSFW feature is not very strong itself
[Fri May 27 2022 23:13:53]Muxto#8483 said: what was the command?
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:03]LolQuattro#0125 said: Well I like boobs so I search up md meme boobs or tits or something
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:15]LolQuattro#0125 said: And they show up
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:18]Muxto#8483 said: I can already see several, but dunno which one to be specific
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:48]Muxto#8483 said: I guess I'll just disable all the NSFW subreddit options manually
[Fri May 27 2022 23:14:58]Muxto#8483 said: for the ordinary `md meme` option
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:02]LolQuattro#0125 said: Ok
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:13]LolQuattro#0125 said: More work for me then ü§£
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:26]LolQuattro#0125 said: Tbh I don‚Äôt even use discord for nsfw stuff
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:27]Muxto#8483 said: Lol, you just use `md nsfwmeme`
[Fri May 27 2022 23:15:41]Muxto#8483 said: good, I mean... bad üò≥

[Sun May 29 2022 21:28:06]DMukto#8483 said: I could make a Discord-based Among Us game bot!
[Sun May 29 2022 21:28:16]DMukto#8483 said: Basically the whole Among Us experience on Discord
[Sun May 29 2022 21:28:36]DMukto#8483 said: will use buttons and try to implement a basic screen-like UI to locate player positions

[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:35]LolQuattro#0125 said: Focus on this current bot at hand
[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:47]DMukto#8483 said: I mean... that bot could pull in some traffic
[Sun May 29 2022 21:30:51]LolQuattro#0125 said: Make other bots after this one fully complete
[Sun May 29 2022 21:31:11]DMukto#8483 said: the thing is..... <@977262952354828308> will never be complete!
[Sun May 29 2022 21:31:26]DMukto#8483 said: It'll always need to be updated according to the latest trends and demands of users
[Sun May 29 2022 21:32:27]DMukto#8483 said: I first thought Dolly would be complete by just having some music features
[Sun May 29 2022 21:32:27]DMukto#8483 said: but then I added more!
[Sun May 29 2022 21:32:36]LolQuattro#0125 said: Ah okay

[Sun May 29 2022 21:33:12]DMukto#8483 said: a type of racing game using a bot
[Sun May 29 2022 21:33:27]DMukto#8483 said: but haven't found a way to make it interesting or cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
