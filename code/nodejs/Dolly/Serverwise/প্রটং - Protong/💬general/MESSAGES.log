[Tue Jan 10 2023 11:06:47]Mukto#4394 said: ohh 😮 🤔
[Tue Jan 10 2023 11:06:50]Mukto#4394 said: that's why

[Tue Jan 10 2023 11:09:29]uthsob_cb#9713 said: English and lot of other things
[Tue Jan 10 2023 11:09:39]Mukto#4394 said: Nice
[Tue Jan 10 2023 11:10:28]uthsob_cb#9713 said: Why don't you join our weekly activity
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:12:58]Mukto#4394 said: oh, I see
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:06]Raspberry#7150 said: "i don't want to put my energy there its unnecesary"
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:06]Mukto#4394 said: that kind of makes sense 🤔
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:15]Raspberry#7150 said: no it doesnt
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:21]Mukto#4394 said: I could be wrong 🤷‍♂️
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:23]Raspberry#7150 said: his point of intro with her is uni
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:24]Mukto#4394 said: 😅
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:30]Mukto#4394 said: Oh
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:31]Raspberry#7150 said: and its online classes during covid
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:37]Bane#0914 said: Oh that’s great, I must profess I haven’t been keeping up to date
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:39]Mukto#4394 said: So they knew each other in-person?1
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:44]Raspberry#7150 said: so the first institute she needs to reach out to is her uni
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:13:56]Mukto#4394 said: ah, I see. No worries, mate. 👍
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:14:14]Raspberry#7150 said: no no they met like online during their courses he is another course mate of hers
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:14:24]Raspberry#7150 said: during covid coz everything was online right
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:14:29]Raspberry#7150 said: now...
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:14:31]Bane#0914 said: But yeah her point of call should have been the university
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:14:45]Raspberry#7150 said: after i said girl u should have done something n her making it lik enah its cool
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:14:47]Raspberry#7150 said: like after
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:00]Mukto#4394 said: if you'd like, you can catch up on some of the info on my YT channel. 😉 
I dropped a link in <#849559177772531722>
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:09]Mukto#4394 said: yep
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:25]Raspberry#7150 said: another semester going by and apparently something more happened with this guy and this time some senior students got involved too and they were like siding with her coz obviously the dude has issues
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:31]Mukto#4394 said: Well.... I'd like to admit something, btw
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:45]Raspberry#7150 said: she tells me all this n she is like "see the fault was with the guy" n im like ya i told u that were u deaf back then
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:47]Raspberry#7150 said: n then she goes
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:52]Mukto#4394 said: After coming to 🇨🇦 , my perspective on ethics, rights, wrongs and cultures have been shifted
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:15:56]Raspberry#7150 said: i want to take action for the threat he gave me
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:16:04]Raspberry#7150 said: i want to contact cyber police
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:16:09]Mukto#4394 said: I realized that everyone has their own perspective, their own decisions, etc.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:16:18]Raspberry#7150 said: im like... bruh u didnt even tell ur uni u wanna tell cyber police??
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:16:25]Bane#0914 said: I mean it’s never too late to report to the university
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:14]Mukto#4394 said: Here, it's kind of like a law that the best you can do is "advise" someone or "suggest" something that could be a benefit for them.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:17]Raspberry#7150 said: i know what u mean but I'll tell u something, the guy already apologised to her n she took the apology, if she brought it up a semester and a half later they'll not take her seriously
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:25]Raspberry#7150 said: n that is what happened when she did bring it up
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:28]Mukto#4394 said: But you cannot take any further steps, sadly 🥲
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:40]Mukto#4394 said: oh wait... what?!
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:42]Mukto#4394 said: Damn
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:52]Mukto#4394 said: I didn't read this part 😲
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:17:59]Mukto#4394 said: yeah, true
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:18:27]Mukto#4394 said: in the beginning, I thought it was a behavioral problem. But I now can see this is pure folly!
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:18:31]Raspberry#7150 said: its not about perspective etc, I'm well aware that people will make their own decisions and they have their own pov, but she...
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:18:39]Raspberry#7150 said: she is a little idk
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:18:41]Raspberry#7150 said: today
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:18:53]Raspberry#7150 said: well technically yesterday
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:18:54]Bane#0914 said: Oh I was assuming it was ongoing
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:03]Mukto#4394 said: is she on Discord? 😂 Maybe I should try my hand at explaining certain concepts.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:25]Mukto#4394 said: oh, wow
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:34]Raspberry#7150 said: amake boltese, you know i realized even my relatives dont want good for me they gossip about others in front of me so im sure they do it behind me about me etc
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:36]Raspberry#7150 said: n i was like
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:37]Raspberry#7150 said: girl
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:44]Raspberry#7150 said: you understand that its very common right
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:47]Raspberry#7150 said: that u do it too right
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:19:54]Raspberry#7150 said: u told me a lot of things about ur relatives too
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:20:03]Raspberry#7150 said: thing is.. gossiping is not good yes
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:20:18]Raspberry#7150 said: but we do discuss our relatives issues with our friends
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:20:26]Raspberry#7150 said: and with other relatives we feel close to
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:20:44]Raspberry#7150 said: its not a 'backstabbing' thing its just something we all tend to do on a larger or smaller scale
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:00]Raspberry#7150 said: its not usually meant in a harmful way
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:22]Bane#0914 said: I don’t really complain about my family to friends
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:23]Raspberry#7150 said: idk if she has an account but ik she doesnt use it
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:34]Raspberry#7150 said: oh i do
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:34]Mukto#4394 said: yeah
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:44]Mukto#4394 said: it's not even proper 'gossip' in that case
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:46]Bane#0914 said: Because while the grievances I might have with family are temporary and forgiven, all my friends will remember is how bad my family is
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:21:53]Raspberry#7150 said: ami tibubhai ke onek shunaisi lmao
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:22:09]Bane#0914 said: Same reason why you don’t complain about your SO with friends unless it’s seriius
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:22:13]Raspberry#7150 said: ok interesting thing here
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:22:34]Mukto#4394 said: it is just informing about news of other relatives, bridging the void of any fact that they might not know yet
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:23:21]Raspberry#7150 said: so my group of friends were like SA ppl who were all raised abroad too, and i think the venting or the complaining helped because we do realize that while there r problems at the end of it all they r still family and its probably coming from a good intention or its something that needs some serious addressing
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:23:54]Raspberry#7150 said: i think i understand what u mean that my friends would hold on to it but ik if u have ppl who understand this special SA family dynamic it helps
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:24:04]Raspberry#7150 said: coz ik that especially for us 3rd culture kids
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:24:15]Raspberry#7150 said: you really need people who understand ur pov
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:24:23]Mukto#4394 said: SA? South Asian, you mean?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:24:31]Mukto#4394 said: 3rd culture? 🤔
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:24:40]Raspberry#7150 said: coz u cant really vent to ur relatives back home, they wont fully understand ur pov
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:01]Raspberry#7150 said: and u cant vent to someone western or raised in the went who have the birth right citizenship thing
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:06]Raspberry#7150 said: believe it or not
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:11]Raspberry#7150 said: there are some very fine differences
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:15]Raspberry#7150 said: yep
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:24]Mukto#4394 said: My question is... why WOULD they even choose relatives to vent their problems to?
It's best to let it out to their best and most loyal friends, instead, right?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:42]Raspberry#7150 said: ppl raised in a culture different from their parents
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:25:54]Mukto#4394 said: Oh, I see 😮
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:26:08]Raspberry#7150 said: oh something related to this specifically
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:26:16]Mukto#4394 said: Luckily, I was born and raised in Sylhet all my life 😅
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:26:26]Mukto#4394 said: and only came abroad in 2021 for university
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:27:04]Raspberry#7150 said: so I've noticed, because of my parents living abroad all these years they are not actually able to fully put their trust on relatives so when i say anything to my relatives n it comes back to them even as a simple comment they take it out of proportion and thing its a big deal
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:27:31]Raspberry#7150 said: so i guess some parents react to venting to relatives almost like telling it to outside people
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:27:39]Raspberry#7150 said: but there is a lot more in this
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:27:41]Raspberry#7150 said: its like
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:28:31]Mukto#4394 said: yeah, that's also weird. Because they don't think it's much of an issue when you tell them to a friend (who is a complete stranger to your family) 😂
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:28:36]Raspberry#7150 said: when u have parents, kids and relatives all in close proximity as much as there is a lot of issues there is a lot of good too, coz the relatives will actually keep ur parents in check so they dont go crazy on u n pressurize u too much
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:28:50]Raspberry#7150 said: joint family dynamics are really interesting
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:28:59]Raspberry#7150 said: if u can make it work, its gonna work out amazing
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:29:17]Raspberry#7150 said: if its shit then best believe its gonna be one of the worst things u ever experience
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:29:35]Mukto#4394 said: Whoa
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:30:12]Raspberry#7150 said: I used to be in a joint family up till a certain point n then we shifted to dhaka n the families slowly broke off into nuclear families
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:30:37]Raspberry#7150 said: n I've had the pleasure of experiencing pros and cons of both settings
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:30:48]Raspberry#7150 said: but yakno this is a very interesting topic
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:30:57]Raspberry#7150 said: mukto bro which family setting would u prefer
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:31:38]Mukto#4394 said: Me? I'm the wrong person to ask these kind of questions 😅 
'cause I'm more focused on other 'bigger' things at hand than personal problems.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:31:48]Mukto#4394 said: I even decided I would not marry, lol 😝
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:32:02]Raspberry#7150 said: ohooo
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:32:13]Raspberry#7150 said: baby niben?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:32:18]Mukto#4394 said: But I'd prefer having a joint family since you can have many relatives to talk to 🤔
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:32:22]Raspberry#7150 said: nile dakben ami khelbo

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:35:36]Bane#0914 said: Is there a point to doing so other than causing conflict?

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:35:59]Raspberry#7150 said: or she'll think she "got away with it"
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:36:25]Bane#0914 said: My Western mindset tells me to be direct with her
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:36:30]Mukto#4394 said: I dunno what to answer for that, but thanks for the inspiration. I'll try to build a special kind of app for phones that detects and even records which which places any other person had visited.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:36:43]Bane#0914 said: Dollyi mindset tells me to bitch about it to all the other family members and let it get back to her
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:37:09]Raspberry#7150 said: oh no no i wont tell other people
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:37:22]Mukto#4394 said: My mindset tells me to ignore all their problems and let them decide it on their own. 😆
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:37:23]Raspberry#7150 said: but im unsure if i should bring it up with her or not
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:37:26]Bane#0914 said: Anyway, I do think it’s better to be tactful here
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:37:54]Mukto#4394 said: yes, you definitely should
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:06]Bane#0914 said: I’d say to her something like “I noticed someone went through my phone… I’d be wary to see if anyone does the same to you, because it’s a huge breach of privacy”
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:19]Mukto#4394 said: what kind of person breaches privacy only to poke at their own curiosity?!
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:31]Bane#0914 said: She’ll know that you know that she did it, but you won’t have to do a conflict with her
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:35]Raspberry#7150 said: ouu i could casually mention the phone being in different places
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:38]Mukto#4394 said: Yeah, nice one
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:51]Mukto#4394 said: Indirectly mention about it, without blaming her
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:38:55]Bane#0914 said: Passive-aggressive is the way to go if you want to keep the peace
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:39:23]Raspberry#7150 said: btw help me figure out if this is a bad thing i have or not
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:39:40]Mukto#4394 said: ( 🥲 I wish I could learn to maintain or adopt this kinda mentality in the foreseeable future. )
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:39:48]Raspberry#7150 said: so, IK there are those thing where u have to be forgiving etc, and there is the "u should have ur boundaries"
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:40:15]Mukto#4394 said: It's the 'you should have your boundaries' case, I would gues
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:40:31]Raspberry#7150 said: I have a thing that as soon as someone does something to me which i think is unacceptable i fully lose all and any kind of feeling towards them so i become completely indifferent

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:41:24]Raspberry#7150 said: and I've had this with some relatives too
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:41:25]Mukto#4394 said: It's not exactly normal, but common. Most people learn to control it. Few don't.

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:41:53]Mukto#4394 said: What you're experiencing is your trust failing in her.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:42:06]Raspberry#7150 said: so im not a crazy person
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:42:16]Bane#0914 said: Good to enforce and be mindful of your boundaries, but I would always assume ignorance over malice in cases like this
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:42:23]Mukto#4394 said: Nope. Not at all.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:42:49]Raspberry#7150 said: I was thinking more like mukti juddho 2.0
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:43:16]Mukto#4394 said: If you're manipulative and skillful enough, you'd be able to live on like this.
By showing your normal face to her, but keeping the truth boiling within you.
In this way, no one suspects anything. And you can remain cautious.

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:45:20]Bane#0914 said: Just be super passive-aggressive
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:45:26]Bane#0914 said: You’ll get a kick out of it
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:45:29]Raspberry#7150 said: ya ik im mad but i'd not be able to actually make myself do it
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:45:39]Bane#0914 said: Especially because she’ll be tortured wondering if you know
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:45:49]Raspberry#7150 said: coz its a reflection on me n i not that kinda person

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:47:05]Mukto#4394 said: True. I've dealt with psychological techniques before. I must say, they work like magic (some of them)!
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:47:24]Bane#0914 said: Yeah it has been a while, hasn’t it?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:47:35]Raspberry#7150 said: is there a way to check logs like which app was used at what time?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:47:47]Raspberry#7150 said: yaaaa lets get on vc sometimes soon :DD
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:01]Mukto#4394 said: The other day some Hungarian fellow messed with the wrong people. And I came in and threatened him to the extent he left he server and even blocked me. Even though he had a better 'bullying' attitude than me. 🤣
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:24]Raspberry#7150 said: ik she is literate enough to not turn on my wifi or to check the unread msgs
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:28]Mukto#4394 said: 🤔 Depends on the phone itself
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:42]Mukto#4394 said: is it an Android or iOS ?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:49]Raspberry#7150 said: so u admitting u a bully?
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:53]Raspberry#7150 said: android
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:48:59]Mukto#4394 said: No, I am not! 🤣
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:49:08]Mukto#4394 said: I am only a bully to other bullies. 😝
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:49:14]Mukto#4394 said: Serves them right.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:49:42]Mukto#4394 said: Most 'evil' bullies are just insecure people who like to vent their anger out on the weak.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:50:08]Mukto#4394 said: But once they encounter someone more toxic than them, they back off.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:50:20]Mukto#4394 said: A weird phenomenon of human nature, I'd say 🤔
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:50:34]Raspberry#7150 said: he a bully guys
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:50:41]Bane#0914 said: Sure after I have breakfast

[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:51:25]Mukto#4394 said: Sure 😄 
People can see me differently according to what they know about me. But the truth never changes.
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:51:32]Raspberry#7150 said: but how can i see which was opened after i slept tho from the screen time
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:52:26]Mukto#4394 said: Unless you've used the phone a lot after she had touched it, I don't think the info is intact anymore. 🥴
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:52:43]Raspberry#7150 said: oooooo
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:52:44]Bane#0914 said: E.g. for me I can see time and then click onto specific apps to see when and how long
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:53:29]Raspberry#7150 said: i didnt have a lot of usage for a while now
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:53:33]Mukto#4394 said: There's also a feature that shows the usage frequency
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:53:42]Raspberry#7150 said: like i said i know when i stopped using it and when i started using it
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:53:52]Raspberry#7150 said: so anything between that is not me using it
[Tue Jan 10 2023 19:54:15]Mukto#4394 said: If not, then check the app usage frequency. If any apps state 'recently used', it might prove she opened them
[Wed Jan 11 2023 10:41:44]Raspberry#7150 said: I-

With regret, I inform you that your server admins have turned corrupt. They're timing me out left and right.
[Fri Jan 13 2023 09:50:17]Mukto#4394 said: How in the world do you expect more people to join your server when you're just banishing them from the conversation? 🥴
[Fri Jan 13 2023 09:50:39]Mukto#4394 said: <@735485879946182758> do you know this person?
[Fri Jan 13 2023 09:51:46]Mukto#4394 said: I literally just joined and was greeting everyone when suddenly an admin came in and stopped me.

[Mon Jan 16 2023 16:16:38]Mukto#4394 said: I just remembered about how I became acquainted with Uthsob. So I'm deciding to provide a brief history.
[Mon Jan 16 2023 16:16:53]Mukto#4394 said: At first, I met someone named Mithun by random chance in a Physics Olympiad back in 2019.
Then I bumped into one of his friends, Sabyasachi <@818164972574998538> .
And afterwards, I was added to an English Practicing chatgroup on Messenger, where I got introduced to <@735485879946182758> and many others.
I'd say, this Discord server has grown a lot since last year.
