Muxto#8483 said: How's Github related here?
Muxto#8483 said: Oh wait...
Muxto#8483 said: The source
Muxto#8483 said: I see
Zibblobet#1429 said: The meme is a github link
Zibblobet#1429 said: YeH
Muxto#8483 said: Basically someone's website. They stored a cat pic there.
Zibblobet#1429 said: Yeah but it's thumbnail is another video somehow
Zibblobet#1429 said: And the site itself is just a troll face
Zibblobet#1429 said: Very interesting
Muxto#8483 said: Oh yeah
Muxto#8483 said: üòÆ
Muxto#8483 said: Jus' realized
Muxto#8483 said: Some clever hacks
Zibblobet#1429 said: Very
Muxto#8483 said: Also.... <@977262952354828308> dutifully records all the msgs now.
Zibblobet#1429 said: Damn
Muxto#8483 said: Soon, I'll add in some security features
Zibblobet#1429 said: China rn
Muxto#8483 said: Also...
Muxto#8483 said: Sends a hell lotta info
Muxto#8483 said: But this info is pretty much useless
Zibblobet#1429 said: Holy shit
Thoris#1906 said: this is the meme channel :(
Zibblobet#1429 said: You need to do a lot of parsing
Zibblobet#1429 said: This is memes
Thoris#1906 said: ok
Muxto#8483 said: Bots are a meme, yes
Zibblobet#1429 said: Very funny meme

Muxto#8483 said: Not really. Thanks to Discord's API, I just need to specify what info I need
Zibblobet#1429 said: Oh damn
Muxto#8483 said: I mean... that's how bots manage to count how many members are there, etc
Zibblobet#1429 said: Yeah makes sense
Zibblobet#1429 said: I haven't used the discord API
Zibblobet#1429 said: I tried Discord.py once and pretty much said "never again"
Muxto#8483 said: So... Do ya make bots?
Zibblobet#1429 said: No
Muxto#8483 said: Oh... Why?
Zibblobet#1429 said: Not a fun experience
Muxto#8483 said: Me, too. But Python is too slow.
Now I'm trying out NodeJS.
Zibblobet#1429 said: Definitely gonna be a lot faster
Zibblobet#1429 said: So far I've just been messing around with C++ and it's standard library
Zibblobet#1429 said: And OpenGL a bit
Zibblobet#1429 said: I've also made a shitty Minecraft clone in WebGL

Zibblobet#1429 said: That roach is gaming
Zibblobet#1429 said: It lived?
Zibblobet#1429 said: I refuse to believe that
Zibblobet#1429 said: Headless chicken situation
