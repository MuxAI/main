¬†

‚ÄúDestroyed‚Äù Voice lines for deployable abilities will now be heard globally by allies. This includes:

Chamber: Trademark and Rendezvous

Killjoy: Turret and Alarmbot

Cypher: Trapwire and Spycam

Yoru: Gatecrash

Solved a bug where Neon‚Äôs High Gear would automatically stop after using Fast Lane or Relay Bolt

Fixed issue where observers would see Viper‚Äôs enemies glow red when they were near but outside of Viper‚Äôs Pit.

Fixed Chamber‚Äôs Rendezvous radius not showing for spectators and observers

Fix: Brimstone‚Äôs Incendiary (Q) feeling damage in chunks of 15 instead of 1 like the other zone damage abilities in the game

Overall DPS should be unchanged.
