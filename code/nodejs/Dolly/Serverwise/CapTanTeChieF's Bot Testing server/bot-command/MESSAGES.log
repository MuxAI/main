[Sat May 28 2022 08:55:10]Muxto#8483 said: but then I decided to switch all the music features to a separate bot

[Sat May 28 2022 08:55:44]Muxto#8483 said: also... <@977262952354828308> auto-deletes unknown links
[Sat May 28 2022 08:56:03]Muxto#8483 said: usually they look very similar to genuine links, so it's hard to tell by most cases
[Sat May 28 2022 08:56:06]Muxto#8483 said: but fear not!
[Sat May 28 2022 08:56:14]Muxto#8483 said: try to misspell a website link
[Sat May 28 2022 08:56:18]Muxto#8483 said: see what happens

[Sat May 28 2022 08:57:52]Muxto#8483 said: but this is a valid link
[Sat May 28 2022 08:57:56]Muxto#8483 said: try an invalid one
[Sat May 28 2022 08:58:00]Muxto#8483 said: once more

[Sat May 28 2022 08:58:29]Muxto#8483 said: this feature works best when someone's acc gets hacked. And then they start sending links in every channel and tags everyone
[Sat May 28 2022 08:58:54]Muxto#8483 said: and to mitigate false positives, it also preserves the original message
[Sat May 28 2022 08:58:55]CapTanTeChieF#8995 said: Interesting
[Sat May 28 2022 08:59:11]Muxto#8483 said: also, yesterday I added this feature :

[Sat May 28 2022 09:01:05]Muxto#8483 said: if you just type `md meme`, then it's totally random. And if you specify a subreddit, `md meme genshinimpact` then it only fetches from there

[Sat May 28 2022 09:03:37]Muxto#8483 said: Although this NSFW is not THAT MUCH of NSFW, since it only fetches some NSFW content from Reddit
[Sat May 28 2022 09:03:43]Muxto#8483 said: Though be careful
[Sat May 28 2022 09:03:49]CapTanTeChieF#8995 said: md waifu
[Sat May 28 2022 09:03:55]Muxto#8483 said: If you pick the wrong subreddit, you'll see the wrong content

[Sat May 28 2022 09:04:32]Muxto#8483 said: Also, I'll not add any features that are purely NSFW
[Sat May 28 2022 09:04:51]Muxto#8483 said: md delete 5
[Sat May 28 2022 09:05:02]Muxto#8483 said: md delete 5
[Sat May 28 2022 09:05:19]Muxto#8483 said: <@976399586669256744> this delete feature is only accessible by admins, btw
[Sat May 28 2022 09:05:39]Muxto#8483 said: in this way, certain powerful tools cannot be misused by other members
[Sat May 28 2022 09:06:11]Muxto#8483 said: (But, for my case, it works even though I'm not an admin, 'cause I set it up in a way that the bot listens to my acc no matter what role I have! XD)
