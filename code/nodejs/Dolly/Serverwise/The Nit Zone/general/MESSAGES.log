[Sat May 28 2022 20:16:42]nint8835#0001 said: Indeed
[Sat May 28 2022 20:17:32]nint8835#0001 said: Didn't expect to see you here, the fact your bot has the capability of doing that is _extremely_ creepy
[Sat May 28 2022 20:18:29]Muxto#8483 said: yeah, don't worry about it. I have my reasons for utilizing such features.

[Sat May 28 2022 20:20:54]nint8835#0001 said: I struggle to think of a valid use for this functionality that couldn't be better solved by an alternative solution that's less creepy
[Sat May 28 2022 20:21:54]Muxto#8483 said: basically an "in case of emergency" feature that would allow me to investigate any server at will, if I spot anyone being bullied or similar.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:23:00]nint8835#0001 said: How would you spot someone being bullied in a way where you would need to abuse a bot to break into the server?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:23:52]Muxto#8483 said: Alright, I'll just reveal a fact. Remember that message tracking algo?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:24:16]nint8835#0001 said: The one that lead to us nuking personal-projects? How could I forget it üòÜ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:24:56]Muxto#8483 said: what? How did that lead to.... oh yeah, that argument that resulted afterwards did it
[Sat May 28 2022 20:25:19]Muxto#8483 said: well... I improved it, so now it tracks 'per channel'
[Sat May 28 2022 20:26:32]nint8835#0001 said: Don't know that I'd class that as "improved"
[Sat May 28 2022 20:27:53]Muxto#8483 said: anyways... I guess you've taken a look at the devlog on <@977262952354828308>'s website. I still haven't added today's one, though.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:28:08]Muxto#8483 said: Today I worked on a virtual currency for it

[Sat May 28 2022 20:32:59]Muxto#8483 said: It's not that I have evil intentions with this bot, lol. üòÜ And for most of the features, I'm progging it all from scratch and relying on some NPM packages now and then.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:33:59]Muxto#8483 said: For MuxMusic, I used a repo `github.com/Adivise/DisSpaceX`
[Sat May 28 2022 20:34:34]Muxto#8483 said: For most of the features. But to my surprise, they all relied on a package called Distube
[Sat May 28 2022 20:35:08]Muxto#8483 said: Dolly is also partly based on that repo. But, I'm renovating it into the way I want
[Sat May 28 2022 20:35:18]Muxto#8483 said: Will add a "credits" section to the website soon
[Sat May 28 2022 20:35:35]Muxto#8483 said: But.... how many credits should I mention? ü§î
[Sat May 28 2022 20:35:48]Muxto#8483 said: A lot of the work was done by NPM packages
[Sat May 28 2022 20:36:14]Muxto#8483 said: and also by me
[Sat May 28 2022 20:36:31]Muxto#8483 said: except MuxMusic's audio features
[Sat May 28 2022 20:36:56]nint8835#0001 said: Regardless of evil intentions, logging all messages and actively looking at those logs is not a good look. It's not uncommon for bots to log messages to the console, but ideally they should never be logged to disk and should only be used for troubleshooting. If you're doing this, I imagine you're going to find it impossible to get your bot through the approval process for more than 100 servers unless you specifically call out that this is something your bot does. Plus at this point, most people I speak to who know you just assume that anything you build is tracking them, which is not exactly great for trying to attract new users
[Sat May 28 2022 20:37:47]Muxto#8483 said: yeah, because it is the truth üòÇ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:37:52]nint8835#0001 said: Generally for NPM packages it'd depend on license. As long as they're not LGPL you're probably fine to not credit them. Devs might appreciate you if you did, but there's no obligation to
[Sat May 28 2022 20:38:28]Muxto#8483 said: I'm just curious at how people are using them
[Sat May 28 2022 20:38:45]Muxto#8483 said: and to track if the bots glitched or broke down for some reason
[Sat May 28 2022 20:38:53]Muxto#8483 said: so I'll have the context ready
[Sat May 28 2022 20:42:35]nint8835#0001 said: For glitching or breaking down, generally you don't need message context for that. Automata is using Sentry, which allows logging and aggregating errors, so you can see at a glance the problems the bot is running into https://sentry.io/welcome/

As for being curious at how people are using them, I can 100% relate to that but there are better ways to do that. Something that immediately comes to mind would be like on the bot first joining, post a message like "I'd love to see how people are using this bot" or something like that, and specifically _ask_ if the people are fine with that and then invite you to the discord only if they say yes. That way you explicitly get permission, there's no creepy logging, and it's clear and straight forward to the users exactly what's happening. Plus I'd imagine in plenty of circumstances, people would be more than happy inviting the dev of a bot they rely on, so they can directly chat with you about their usage or ping you on issues or whatever
[Sat May 28 2022 20:42:43]Muxto#8483 said: whoops
[Sat May 28 2022 20:43:03]Muxto#8483 said: I'm sorry I forgot to mention about the auto-delete un-whitelisted URL feature üòÖ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:43:15]Muxto#8483 said: but luckily, it preserves the msg
[Sat May 28 2022 20:43:18]nint8835#0001 said: Oh yeah I'm aware of that, I saw your story about the challenge to try and break it
[Sat May 28 2022 20:43:35]nint8835#0001 said: I was planning on testing it and then got kinda derailed by you appearing out of nowhere üòÜ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:43:45]Muxto#8483 said: I see. üòÖ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:44:11]nint8835#0001 said: How does the functionality work? Like how does whitelisting or detection work?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:44:26]Muxto#8483 said: I see
[Sat May 28 2022 20:44:52]Muxto#8483 said: Before today, I didn't know how to handle JSONs well. So... as of now, it's mainly an array
[Sat May 28 2022 20:45:14]Muxto#8483 said: I'll change it to an external JSON file later on
[Sat May 28 2022 20:45:30]nint8835#0001 said: I'm not even referring to at that level, I mean like is it a list of hardcoded URLs, a list of permitted domains, permitted regexes, etc.?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:46:01]Muxto#8483 said: aye, somewhat

[Sat May 28 2022 20:47:14]Muxto#8483 said: I mean... I'm already aware of the fact that anyone can override the settings like this :

[Sat May 28 2022 20:47:44]Muxto#8483 said: it's the latter
[Sat May 28 2022 20:47:51]Muxto#8483 said: as in... you broke it easily
[Sat May 28 2022 20:48:21]Muxto#8483 said: and I'm not surprised, since I already got to know about this weakness at the time of posting about the challenge
[Sat May 28 2022 20:48:35]nint8835#0001 said: What's your plan to address it?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:49:27]Muxto#8483 said: ü§î Haven't thought of it yet, but I assume I'd need to let it parse the URL more carefully.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:49:38]nint8835#0001 said: Yup, exactly
[Sat May 28 2022 20:49:59]Muxto#8483 said: By specifying the string to be recorded upto the '/' slah
[Sat May 28 2022 20:50:00]Muxto#8483 said: *slah
[Sat May 28 2022 20:50:03]Muxto#8483 said: *slash
[Sat May 28 2022 20:50:14]Muxto#8483 said: right after the domain name ends
[Sat May 28 2022 20:50:22]nint8835#0001 said: You'd need to do basically two things:
- Parse every URL, so you can't bypass by posting a valid URL and an invalid URL in a message
- Parse every URL carefully, so you can't do what you referred to by jamming a valid URL in the path
[Sat May 28 2022 20:51:06]Muxto#8483 said: Aye, aye, captain Riley! Got it. üòÅ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:51:47]Muxto#8483 said: So you've learnt plenty about my bots and how they work.
What about yours?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:52:09]Muxto#8483 said: What purpose and features does <@757038965155954688> serve?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:52:27]nint8835#0001 said: Just a warning though that URLs are shockingly complex, so depending on how you implement it it may be pretty easy to build a bypass, so my suggestion would be to not try and parse the URL yourself, but rather use a tested & trusted parser to handle that
[Sat May 28 2022 20:52:44]nint8835#0001 said: Currently, nothing. When last used it was an integration for Home Assistant
[Sat May 28 2022 20:53:00]nint8835#0001 said: So I could get notifications when coming and going from home, turning lights on and off, etc.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:53:10]nint8835#0001 said: Never ended up using it though, and it's not actually something I built myself
[Sat May 28 2022 20:53:10]Muxto#8483 said: I see. So another parser module?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:53:22]Muxto#8483 said: ooo üòÆ Nit sounds Neat
[Sat May 28 2022 20:53:39]Muxto#8483 said: And... I assume you had to use webhooks for that?
[Sat May 28 2022 20:54:07]nint8835#0001 said: Yup, looks like there's one actually in Node already. You'd want to use this and match on the hostname or origin https://nodejs.org/api/url.html
[Sat May 28 2022 20:54:11]Muxto#8483 said: Today I was trying to get a grasp of Discord webhooks and even tried to get <@977262952354828308> create some. But sadly couldn't.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:54:28]nint8835#0001 said: Nope, not webhooks - webhooks don't show as users in the sidebar
[Sat May 28 2022 20:54:55]nint8835#0001 said: I _wish_ it were webhooks, rather than having to manage a bot user for it
[Sat May 28 2022 20:55:52]Muxto#8483 said: Tbh, I still don't get the purpose of a webhook. Why'd anyone want that instead of a bot. ü•¥
[Sat May 28 2022 20:56:25]nint8835#0001 said: Webhooks are really good for things you want to just fire off a message and not worry about it
[Sat May 28 2022 20:56:49]nint8835#0001 said: Since a bot you need to actually go through the complex process of opening up a bot connection, dealing with a discord library of some sort, etc.
[Sat May 28 2022 20:57:06]Muxto#8483 said: Ah, yes. From what I've seen, they're used in bots like NQN and even the persona bot that someone in MUNCSS uses
[Sat May 28 2022 20:57:19]nint8835#0001 said: Webhooks are just a post to a URL. They're simple enough I've built automations around them just using the built in automation tooling on iPhones
[Sat May 28 2022 20:58:10]nint8835#0001 said: You can probably infer based on the title what this one does üòÜ
[Sat May 28 2022 20:58:57]Muxto#8483 said: Lol. Nice
[Sat May 28 2022 21:00:41]nint8835#0001 said: Another benefit to webhooks is the amount of stuff that has support for integrating with them. So for example, I have a discord server for a piece of software I made, and there's a channel that automatically has notifications posted for new events that happen on the GitHub repo for it
[Sat May 28 2022 21:01:10]Muxto#8483 said: cool
[Sat May 28 2022 21:01:20]Muxto#8483 said: wish they'd teach stuff like this at MUN ü•≤
[Sat May 28 2022 21:02:41]Muxto#8483 said: speaking of which, I assume you're already knowledgeable about the entire course structure and content taught in CS here.
So... can you name all the prog langs and frameworks/runtimes that they'll teach us throughout the 4 year span?
[Sat May 28 2022 21:02:54]nint8835#0001 said: I mean webhooks I imagine they _kinda_ do, depending on the courses you take. Fundamentally a webhook is basically just a name for a API that gets a request sent to it on an incoming event - they're not really anything special
[Sat May 28 2022 21:02:56]Muxto#8483 said: So far, I've come across Python, Java, Fortran, C, iVerilog
[Sat May 28 2022 21:03:22]Muxto#8483 said: and some TOY in CS1003
[Sat May 28 2022 21:04:12]nint8835#0001 said: My CS degree is pretty derailed at this point, due to <:colab:638469585711923210> happening. So far I think all I've used is Python, Java, SystemVerilog, TOY, and ARM64 ASM
[Sat May 28 2022 21:04:23]nint8835#0001 said: I'll double check my transcript, see if there's anything I'm forgetting about
[Sat May 28 2022 21:05:00]Muxto#8483 said: nah, 'tis fine. No need to stress it.
[Sat May 28 2022 21:05:40]nint8835#0001 said: Ah right, missed the unnamed language I refer to as InvitationASM (which you won't be doing now I don't think because people don't do 1000 anymore) and R
[Sat May 28 2022 21:05:43]Muxto#8483 said: So... no Angular, React, Node, Go, Rust, Ruby, or Flask? ü•≤
[Sat May 28 2022 21:06:01]Muxto#8483 said: ah yes, there was a bit of R in STAT2550
[Sat May 28 2022 21:06:30]nint8835#0001 said: Flask was used when I took 2005, none of the other ones though. A lot of the stuff is more theoretical
[Sat May 28 2022 21:06:36]Muxto#8483 said: I guess I made the right choice to learn 'em on my own instead of waiting for academic opportunities
[Sat May 28 2022 21:06:45]nint8835#0001 said: Oh yeah 100%
[Sat May 28 2022 21:06:53]Muxto#8483 said: okeeee
