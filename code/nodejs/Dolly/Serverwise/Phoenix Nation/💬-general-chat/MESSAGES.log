Reshildship127#3113 said: Oi some of them are not
Muxto#8483 said: don't worry. It records the message and who sent it, before deleting
Muxto#8483 said: so that you can manually check
Muxto#8483 said: trust me, if you've ever been raided by a hacked acc, you'll understand the pain and danger of having someone spam up so many links üíÄ
Reshildship127#3113 said: ik lol
Muxto#8483 said: the worst part is, the 'best' malicious site links look almost exactly the same as the genuine ones. That's why some dumb people end up clicking on them intentionally or accidentally.
