Muxto#8483 said: Okeee
Muxto#8483 said: Everything is still the way it was 24 hrs ago
Muxto#8483 said: Currently working on music functionalities from scratch 'cause apparently there's a new version of DiscordJS (v13) that needs everything to be recoded
Muxto#8483 said: It's kind of like migrating a program from Python v2 to v3
LolQuattro#0125 said: pls meme
LolQuattro#0125 said: pls meme
Muxto#8483 said: Now every bot is using buttons! ü•¥
Muxto#8483 said: No problems. I'll add drop-down menus and built-in forms to my bots. (Though they too exist. 'Cause it's part of the Discord API)
Muxto#8483 said: <@523963627913478184> try sending a sus link
LolQuattro#0125 said: I dont know any sus links
Muxto#8483 said: just make one
Muxto#8483 said: misspell one
LolQuattro#0125 said: www.cornhub.com
LolQuattro#0125 said: not working
Muxto#8483 said: hmm ü§î
Muxto#8483 said: 'cause it's not a link
Muxto#8483 said: the highlight should be there
Muxto#8483 said: as in... clickable
Muxto#8483 said: beginning with 'https'
LolQuattro#0125 said: ok my parents are around not now
Muxto#8483 said: lol
LolQuattro#0125 said: https://www.cornhub.com
Muxto#8483 said: what kinda link were you about to send ?
LolQuattro#0125 said: ok now it worked
Muxto#8483 said: XD
LolQuattro#0125 said: cornhub
Muxto#8483 said: lol
LolQuattro#0125 said: its an actual site check it out
LolQuattro#0125 said: just filled with corn
LolQuattro#0125 said: not p***
Muxto#8483 said: üåΩ maize, you mean
LolQuattro#0125 said: corn you fool
Muxto#8483 said: Americans say maize, right? Or is it the Brits?
LolQuattro#0125 said: corn you fool
LolQuattro#0125 said: who tf says maizeü§£
LolQuattro#0125 said: but cool feature
LolQuattro#0125 said: to safeguard from sus links <@784119755111661569>
Muxto#8483 said: yep
LolQuattro#0125 said: https://youtube.com
LolQuattro#0125 said: how will it know sus links from regular ones
Muxto#8483 said: 'cause often people don't realize what they're clicking since the most malicious ones look exact
Muxto#8483 said: easy. For now, there's a list of whitelisted domains
Muxto#8483 said: such as `youtube.com`, `google.com`
Muxto#8483 said: if any link is a scam link, obviously it has a misspelling in it
Muxto#8483 said: so it won't match
LolQuattro#0125 said: oh
LolQuattro#0125 said: so if I was to send a good site but thats not in the whitelist it wouldnt work
Muxto#8483 said: also... we ourselves don't trust any new websites or links we see, until one of our 'approved' friends informs us that it is safe, right?
Same concept here. Simple, but effective. Especially for kids' servers and those who tend to click all links they find. ü§£
LolQuattro#0125 said: https://tinywow.com
LolQuattro#0125 said: yep it got removed
LolQuattro#0125 said: but its not a sus site
Muxto#8483 said: note the `unknown` word used instead of `suspicious` or `malicious`
LolQuattro#0125 said: I see
Muxto#8483 said: yeah, I understand
Muxto#8483 said: this should clarify
LolQuattro#0125 said: Yea i see
Muxto#8483 said: a bot is basically a dumb human
Muxto#8483 said: you gotta specify everything for them
LolQuattro#0125 said: lol
LolQuattro#0125 said: sounds very much like some people I knowü§£
LolQuattro#0125 said: pls meme
LolQuattro#0125 said: lol
Muxto#8483 said: nice timing for that meme
Muxto#8483 said: also... I whitelisted that image source domain beforehand, otherwise <@977262952354828308> would've deleted <@270904126974590976>'s msg
LolQuattro#0125 said: mux day sounds malicious
LolQuattro#0125 said: no
Muxto#8483 said: lol, why?
LolQuattro#0125 said: more like devious üòà
LolQuattro#0125 said: its like a bot that wants to overthrow other bots
Muxto#8483 said: heh heh. Basically Mux is the prefix I use for my branding
