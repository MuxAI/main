Muxto#8483 said: although.... since the bot is running on my laptop instead of a web server... (plus, in a virtual machine) there will be lagging if filters are used
Muxto#8483 said: md queue
LolQuattro#0125 said: I see
Muxto#8483 said: md skip

Muxto#8483 said: md filter vaporwave
Muxto#8483 said: hehe... the filters work on any stream of audio, since it's applied after the audio is received at the buffer
Muxto#8483 said: also, today I learnt several lessons
Muxto#8483 said: as in... hard mistakes
LolQuattro#0125 said: oh
Muxto#8483 said: Such as using too many comments in the code
Muxto#8483 said: I noticed that the quality of the audio dropped
Muxto#8483 said: since more lines = more data for the buffer = more latency
