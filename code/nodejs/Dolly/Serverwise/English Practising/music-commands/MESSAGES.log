[Sun May 29 2022 11:38:10]DMukto#8483 said: the account files are stored as JSON files

[Sun May 29 2022 12:15:28]DMukto#8483 said: to simulate a whole "game" on Discord
[Sun May 29 2022 12:15:43]wumpus#9713 said: wow that would be great
[Sun May 29 2022 12:16:20]DMukto#8483 said: for now, I planned there would be wanted levels. If you steal too much, your wanted lvl would increase. And then certain services will stop working.
[Sun May 29 2022 12:16:40]wumpus#9713 said: btw there buttons  are not working properly in music thing
[Sun May 29 2022 12:16:42]DMukto#8483 said: And if you get caught and arrested, you'll go to jail. Which means you cannot use ANY services of the bot for a few days
[Sun May 29 2022 12:17:12]DMukto#8483 said: ah, yes. I'm aware of that. But nowadays I'm so busy with <@977262952354828308> that I don't get time to look at <@900766190266368051> 🥴 😅
[Sun May 29 2022 12:19:23]wumpus#9713 said: do you tried promoting your bot on any social media?
